* GUI (Marcus)
	o Gamestates - menu/ingame/options/etc. (Leonard & Marcus)
	o Widgets and Panels
	o 'Layout managers'
* Models (Marcus)
	o Primarily meshes
	o Textures are secondary

		* For already existing ones, re-render with transparent background

* Enemy AI
	o Improve it!
* Player AI: (Alexander)
	o Unitconstruction
		* Re-level ground where you build buildings.
* Implement upgrades for units and prerequisites for building units and performing upgrades
* Handle building of near-earth geothermal energy stations correctly (can only 
  be built on cracks in the ground) (Marcus)
* Add cracks and positions of them in the terrain (by altering heightmap?)
* Sound effects (any of us)
	o Click/selection sounds (Marcus)
	o Walk sounds
	o Attack sounds (Marcus)
	o Ambient sounds (Leo)
* Fog of War
	o Render volumetrically?
* Missions (Marcus)
	o Events (triggered by X) - executes a lua-script when triggered

* Player AI:
	o Stances (aggressive, defensive, stand ground, do nothing)
	o Make order queues easier to use? 
* Music (Leo? Maybe Alexander too?)
* Effect engine
	o Volumetric fog at thermal energy sources
* Add water textures
* Terrain
	o Multitextured
	o Cast shadows
* Pixel shaders (Alexander)
* Stable Windows-executable
* Use VBOs for rendering units, terrain and particles
* Fix remaining crash-bugs
