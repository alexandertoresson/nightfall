IMPORTANT ----------------------------------------------------------------------
* GUI (Marcus)
	o Gamestates - menu/ingame/options/etc. (Leonard & Marcus)
	o Widgets and Panels
* Fix problems in pathfinding (Leo)
	o Cancel searching for a path after a certain number of steps to prevent
	  infinite searches.
	o If no path is found, make the unit go to the 'nearest' square found.
	o Implement some fast way of finding out whether a path can be found or
	  not?
* Skybox (fix rendering bug) (Marcus)
* Render projectiles & handle their flight in calls in AI scripts (Alexander)
* Models (Marcus)
	o Primarily meshes
	o Textures are secondary
	o Unit & Technology thumbnails 128x128
* Enemy AI (just something simple to begin with)
* Day/night cycle, Gaia AI, lights on light towers and other light sources (Leo)
* Player AI: (Alexander)
	o Implement aggressive stance as default hardcoded stance
	o Unitconstruction (unit will walk to a place and start building, 
                            buildings build units but they won't appear until 
                            they're 100% done)
		* Re-level ground where you build buildings.
	o Link all this into the GUI when it's done.
* Implement upgrades for units
* Handle building of near-earth geothermal energy stations correctly (can only 
  be built on cracks in the ground) (Marcus)
* Add cracks and positions of them in the terrain (by altering heightmap?)
* Calculate SquareIsWalkable and GetTraversalTime correctly according to unit 
  type and terrain type (Alexander)
* Only render units on visible terrain squares, this is quite easy and can be 
  swiftly done (Alexander)
* Sound effects (any of us)
	o Click/selection sounds (Marcus)
	o Walk sounds
	o Attack sounds (Marcus)
	o Ambient sounds (Leo)
* Fog of War (Alexander)
* Missions (Marcus)
	o Events (triggered by X) - executes a lua-script when triggered

NOT IMPORTANT (ordered by priority) --------------------------------------------
* Fix terrain engine fov (not necessary but we might want to do it anyway)
* Player AI:
	o Stances (aggressive, defensive, stand ground, do nothing)
	o Add order queues (so you could for example set a unit to first build 
	                    one thing, then goto a place, then build another 
	                    thing etc)
* Music (Leo? Maybe Alexander too?)
* Effect engine
	o Volumetric fog at thermal energy sources
	o 2D Particle engine for explosions
* Add water textures
* Terrain
	o Multitextured
	o Cast shadows
* Pixel shaders (Alexander)
* Stable Windows-executable

(*
I'm proposing the following map-structure:
resources/missions/Tutorial.lua

Tutorial.lua: (pseudokod)
	LoadHeightmap("resources/mission/lunar.heightmap")
	player1 = CreatePlayer("newbie", ...)
	PutPlayer(player1, 10, 10) -- x och y-position
	player2 = CreatePlayer("enemy", ...)
	PutPlayer(player2, 100, 100)
	
	PutEvent("myScriptFileToExecute", EVENTS.WHEN_USER_ENTERS_AREA, 
	         CreateArea(20, 20, 20, 20)) -- x, y, w, h
	
	AddSomeTreesAndStuff
	
	DisplayDialog("Some fancy message")
	etc.
